<!--
    Genaral Code 
  * Design choices are explained and documented in comments.
  * DOM elements are styled via CSS.  
  Add Books
  * Users can enter book title, author, subjects, language and add new Books.
  * The Bookshelf instance is updated accordingly.
  * The Bookshelf instance renders Books accurately.
  Navigation
  * A Navigation Bar is included in the web app with links to other parts of the site e.g. 
  "About", "Contact".
  * No real information is required. Dummy data or lorum ipsum is fine!
   Comments 
  * Users can leave comments no longer than 280 characters on any Book they want. 
  * Users can press a "Comment" button which reveals a `text` input element.
  * Users can then type their comment and click "send" to add it to the Book.
  * Comments should be represented by HTML elements on the page.
  * The Book and Bookshelf instances are updated accordingly.
  * The comments persist even if a search or sort rerenders the Books.
  * Data can be stored locally or in state memory. A database is not required.
    Alternate Assessment Requirements
    Note: do not complete any of the following unless assigned by your instructional team
  * TDD 2 Alternate: `filter` is used to implement a DOM element containing the titles of all Books that have been favorited
  * TDD 5 Alternate: `reduce` is used to implement a counter on the page of the number of non-English books in the collection 
    Optional: Registration
  * Users should not be able to access the book data unless they have registered a new username and password combination. 
  * After registering, users should be redirected to the Bookshelf Web App where they can see the book data, add books to the bookshelf, etc.
  * These credentials do not need to be stored in a database and encrypted for sign in later. This is just an exercise to get us closer to real world web applications.
